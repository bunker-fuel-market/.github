<p data-block-id="216dbaa4-0f1a-4460-9d69-eae781cffe1c" data-pm-slice="1 1 []">New environmental laws are changing the Bunker Fuel Market. They aim to reduce sulfur emissions and greenhouse gases. The IMO 2020 sulfur cap has lowered sulfur content in bunker fuel over the last five years. Low sulfur products like very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO) and marine gas oil (MGO) have increased in demand. New rules on greenhouse gas emissions will arrive soon. These changes will push the industry toward alternative fuels like liquid natural gas (LNG), methanol, and ammonia. Shipping operators and bunker fuel suppliers must invest in new technologies and infrastructure to switch fuels or remain competitive. Transitioning from high sulfur fuel to cleaner options is more than just compliance. It represents a significant market shift that affects fuel pricing, supply chain logistics, and investment strategies.</p>

</ul>
<p data-block-id="a91ba113-8d4d-4b7a-bcf5-f995d472db5c">Technological changes greatly impact the bunker fuel market. Engine design, fuel efficiency, and alternative fuels influence both demand and supply. For example, dual-fuel engines let some ships use both traditional and alternative fuels. This helps ship owners shift to cleaner options. Advances in carbon capture and storage will lower greenhouse gas emissions from conventional fuels. Digitization and analytics will transform the bunker fuel market. They will enhance fuel operations and support vessel performance. These changes will improve supply chain efficiency and reduce environmental impact. This creates new opportunities for fuel suppliers and tech providers. It also opens doors for growth in the bunker fuel market.</p>
